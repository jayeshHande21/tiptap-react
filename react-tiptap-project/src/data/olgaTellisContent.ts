Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985) is one of the most significant judgments in Indian constitutional law, especially in the context of socio-economic rights. The case arose when the Bombay Municipal Corporation decided to evict pavement dwellers from public spaces in Mumbai, citing urban planning and sanitation concerns. Olga Tellis, a journalist and activist, filed a public interest litigation on behalf of the affected individuals, arguing that such eviction violated their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution.

The petitioners contended that the right to life under Article 21 must include the right to livelihood, as depriving someone of their shelter and means of earning a living effectively strips them of the ability to survive. The Supreme Court, in a landmark interpretation, agreed with this view and held that the right to livelihood is an integral part of the right to life. The judgment emphasized that the Constitution is not merely a legal document but a living instrument that must be interpreted in light of the socio-economic realities of the country.

The Court also acknowledged the dilemma faced by municipal authorities in balancing urban development with human rights. However, it ruled that any eviction must be carried out with due process and adequate rehabilitation measures. The judgment laid down guidelines for future evictions, including notice periods, hearings, and alternative housing arrangements.

This case has had a profound impact on Indian jurisprudence. It has been cited in numerous subsequent rulings related to housing rights, urban displacement, and the interpretation of Article 21. It also paved the way for a more expansive understanding of fundamental rights, moving beyond mere civil liberties to include socio-economic entitlements.

In conclusion, Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation stands as a testament to the judiciary’s role in upholding the dignity of marginalized communities. It reminds us that constitutional rights must be accessible to all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status, and that the law must serve as a shield for the vulnerable rather than a tool of exclusion.
